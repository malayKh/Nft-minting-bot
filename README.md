# Nft-minting-bot
This is a simple nft mint bot. As this is only created to function on your local environment and will run through api calls excuting cli commands, the project is crude.
The app looks for events emitted on the blockchain and asks the user to select a function to call for executing the nft mint. Doing so will call the blockchain to mint
the nft once the event executes in theory allowing you to execute the mint automatically once the first nft has been minted.
